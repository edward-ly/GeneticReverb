# Genetic Reverb

A MATLAB script that uses a genetic algorithm to generate a random impulse response describing the reverberation of an artificial room. It also accepts a WAV audio file as input to allow for hearing the reverb effect on an audio source.

You can also load the generated impulse response into other programs such as my simple [IR Reverb](https://github.com/edward-ly/reverb-pd) Pure Data patch or the [Convolution Reverb](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/convolution-reverb/) device in [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/) to perform the reverb effect in real-time.

## Running the Script

Open the `main.m` script in the MATLAB editor and adjust parameter values as needed. Then you can click on __Editor > Run__ or run `main` in the MATLAB command window.
