# Genetic Reverb

A MATLAB script that uses a genetic algorithm to generate an impulse response describing the reverberation of an artificial room. It also accepts a WAV audio file as input to allow for hearing the reverb effect on an audio source.

You can also load the generated impulse response into the [IR Reverb](https://github.com/edward-ly/reverb-pd) Pure Data patch to perform the reverb effect in real-time.

## Running the Script

Open the `main.m` script in the MATLAB editor and adjust parameter values as needed. Then you can click on __Editor > Run__ or run `main` in the MATLAB command window.
